# Frontend (Next.js)

This directory contains a minimal Next.js application used in the demo.

## Development

Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` inside this folder to start the development server.

The frontend uses **Tailwind CSS** and basic components from **shadcn/ui**. A login page redirects to the backend which handles the Zitadel authorization code flow.
